/**
 * Created by tuhin mandal on 9/19/2016.
 * <p>
 * This class demonstrates BFT traversal of graph.
 * <p>
 * code reference : http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/breadth-first-traversal-for-a-graph/
 * Breadth First Traversal (or Search) for a graph is similar to Breadth First Traversal of a tree (See method 2 of this
 * post). The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again. To
 * avoid processing a node more than once, we use a boolean visited array. For simplicity, it is assumed that all
 * vertices are reachable from the starting vertex.
 * For example, in the following graph, we start traversal from vertex 2. When we come to vertex 0, we look for all
 * adjacent vertices of it. 2 is also an adjacent vertex of 0. If we donâ€™t mark visited vertices, then 2 will be
 * processed again and it will become a non-terminating process. A Breadth First Traversal of the following
 * graph is 2, 0, 3, 1.
 *

 *  0-------1
 *  |      /
 *  |     /
 *  |    /       |---
 *  |   /        | /
 *   2-----------3 [3 has a cycle to itself]
